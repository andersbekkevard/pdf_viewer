# Architectural Decision Records

This directory holds ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) for `pdf_viewer`.

## What an ADR is

An ADR is a short, dated document capturing **one architectural decision** —
the context that forced a choice, the decision itself, the rationale behind
it, and the consequences that follow. One decision per file.

Popularized by Michael Nygard (2011); format used widely across the
industry.

## Why we bother

Code shows *what* the system does. Commit messages and PR descriptions show
*what changed*. Neither durably captures *why* a given architectural choice
was made or what alternatives were rejected. Within a few weeks the
reasoning is in the maintainer's head only; within a few months it's gone
entirely.

ADRs exist to preserve the **why**, so that future-me (or a future Claude
session, or anyone reading the repo cold) can:

1. Understand the constraints at the time of the decision
2. See what alternatives were considered and why they were rejected
3. Know which consequences were accepted deliberately (vs. accidental)
4. Decide whether to supersede an ADR when the constraints change

ADRs are **immutable in principle**: you don't rewrite history. When a
decision needs revisiting, write a new ADR that *supersedes* the older
one, and mark the old one Superseded. This preserves the reasoning at
each point in time.

## Filename format

`NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` — four-digit zero-padded index, hyphens, `.md`.

## Structure used here

Every ADR in this folder has these sections:

- **Status** — Accepted / Proposed / Superseded / Deprecated
- **Date** — when the decision was made
- **Context** — the problem or constraints that prompted the choice
- **Decision** — what we chose, stated crisply
- **Rationale** — why this over alternatives
- **Consequences** — what follows (good and bad, both)
- **Related** — references to other ADRs, docs, code, links

Keep each ADR self-contained and scannable. If it exceeds ~400 lines,
it's probably two decisions in one file.
